# spdx-java-spreadsheet-store

Stores SPDX documents in Microsoft Excel formats.  Supports both XLS and XLSX file types.

This store supports serializing and deserializing files in XLS and XLSX spreadsheet formats.

This library utilizes the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface) extending the `ExtendedSpdxStore` which allows for utilizing any underlying store which implements the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface).

## Using the Library

This library is intended to be used in conjunction with the [SPDX Java Library](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library).

Create an instance of a store which implements the [SPDX Java Library Storage Interface](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library#storage-interface).  For example, the [InMemSpdxStore](https://github.com/spdx/Spdx-Java-Library/blob/master/src/main/java/org/spdx/storage/simple/InMemSpdxStore.java) is a simple in-memory storage suitable for simple file serializations and deserializations.

Create an instance of `SpreadsheetStore(IModelStore baseStore, SpreadsheetFormatType spreadsheetFormat)` passing in the instance of a store created above along with the format.  The format is one of the following:

- `XLS` - Microsoft Excel 97 to 2003 Workbook format
- `XLSX` - Microsoft Excel workbook format

## Serializing and Deserializing

This library supports the `ISerializableModelStore` interface for serializing and deserializing files based on the format specified.

## Development Status

Mostly stable - although it has not been widely used.
